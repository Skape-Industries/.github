skape Industries LLC, doing business as "Skape", is the developer of computer application software for mobile phones, 
namely, software for connecting individuals seeking lawn mowing, snow plowing, mulching, leaf removal, weeding, and hedge trimming services 
with local landscaping and snow plowing companies. 

The goal of our mobile apps is to bring landscapers and homeowners together to create jobs, beautify communities and significantly improve the environment by turning towards a greener and more environmentally-friendly mode of landscaping. 

We think Skape is a big idea .. not just a great business idea, but a world-changing, environment-saving, headache-eliminating idea .. and we hope you will join us on our incredible journey.
